In the case of DAGs, outbound nodes are the \"target\" tasks (tasks with no children). In the case of steps, outbound nodes are all the containers involved in the last step group. NOTE: since templates are composable, the list of outbound nodes are carried upwards when a DAG/steps template invokes another DAG/steps template. In other words, the outbound nodes of a template, will be a superset of the outbound nodes of its last children.",
